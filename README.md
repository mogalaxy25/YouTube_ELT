# YouTube_ELT – End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline

An end-to-end ELT pipeline that extracts data from the YouTube Data API, transforms raw JSON data into structured analytics-ready tables, and loads it into a relational database.

This project was completed as part of the Udemy Data Engineering course by Matthew Schembri and demonstrates practical implementation of real-world data engineering workflows using Python.

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a production-style data pipeline that:

- Extracts raw video and channel data from the YouTube API
- Transforms nested JSON into structured tabular datasets
- Loads cleaned data into a database for analysis
- Follows modular, scalable pipeline design principles

This project emphasizes clean architecture, modular code design, and separation of concerns (Extract → Transform → Load).
